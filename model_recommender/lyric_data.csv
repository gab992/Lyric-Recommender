and there was a booming above you that night black airplanes flew over the sea and they were lowing and shifting like beached whales shelled snails as you strained and you squinted to see the retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry you froze in your sand shoal prayed for your poor soul sky seemed a bread roll soaking in a milkbowl and when the bread broke fell in bricks of wet smoke my sleeping heart woke and my waking heart spoke then there was a silence you took to mean something mean run sing for alive you will evermore be and the plague of the greasy black engines askulking has gone east while youre left to explain them to me released from their hairless and blind cavalry with your hands in your pockets stubbily running to where im unfresh undressed and yawning well what is this craziness this crazy talking you caught some small death when you were sleepwalking it was a dark dream darlin its over the firebreather is beneath the clover beneath his breathing there is cold clay forever a toothless hounddog choking on a feather but i took my fishing pole fearing your fever down to the swimming hole where there grows a bitter herb that blooms but one day a year by the riverside id bring it here apply it gently to the love youve lent me while the river was twisting and braiding the bait bobbed and the string sobbed as it cut through the hustling breeze and i watched how the water was kneading so neatly gone treacly nearly slowed to a stop in this heat frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath press on me we are restless things webs of seaweed are swaddling you call upon the dusk of the musk of a squid shot full of ink until you sink into your crib rowing along among the reeds among the rushes i heard your song before my heart had time to hush it smell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking and when the fire moves away fire moves away son why would you say i was the last one scrape your knee it is only skin makes the sound of violins when i cut your hair and leave the birds all the trimmings i am the happiest woman among all women and the shallow water stretches as far as i can see knee deep trudging along the seagull weeps so long im humming a threshing song until the night is over hold on hold on hold your horses back from the fickle dawn i have got some business out at the edge of town candy weighing both of my pockets down till i can hardly stay afloat from the weight of them and knowing how the commonfolk condemn what it is i do to you to keep you warm being a woman being a woman but always up the mountainside youre clambering groping blindly hungry for anything picking through your pocket linings well what is this scrap of sassafras eh sisyphus i see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain little sister he will be back again i have washed a thousand spiders down the drain spiders ghosts hang soaked and dangling silently from all the blooming cherry trees in tiny nooses safe from everyone nothing but a nuisance gone now dead and done be a woman be a woman though we felt the spray of the waves we decided to stay till the tide rose too far we werent afraid cause we know what you are and you know that we know what you are awful atoll o incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow bawl bellow sibyl seacow all done up in a bow toddle and roll teethe an impalpable bit of leather while yarrow heather and hollyhock awkwardly molt along the shore are you mine my heart mine anymore stay with me for awhile thats an awfully real gun and though life will lay you down as the lightning has lately done failing this failing this follow me my sweetest friend to see what you anointed in pointing your gun there lay it down nice and slow there is nowhere to go save up up where the light undiluted is weaving in a drunk dream at the sight of my baby out back back on the patio watching the bats bring night in while elsewhere estuaries of waxwhite wend endlessly towards seashores unmapped last week our picture window produced a halfword heavy and hollow hit by a brown bird we stood and watched her gape like a rattlesnake and pant and labor over every intake i said a sort of prayer for some rare grace then thought i ought to take her to a higher place said dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you and though you die bird you will have a fine view then in my hot hand she slumped her sick weight we tramped through the poison oak heartbroke and inchoate the dogs were snapping so you cuffed their collars while i climbed the treehouse then how i hollered cause shed lain as still as a stone in my palm for a lifetime or two then saw the treetops cocked her head and up and flew while back in the world that moves often according to the hoarding of these clues dogs still run roughly around little tufts of finchdown the cities we passed were a flickering wasteland but his hand in my hand made them hale and harmless while down in the lowlands the crops are all coming we have everything life is thundering blissful towards death in a stampede of his fumbling green gentleness you stopped by i was all alive in my doorway we shucked and jived and when you wept i was gone see i got gone when i got wise but i cant with certainty say we survived then down and down and down and down and down and deeper stoke without sound the blameless flames you endless sleeper through fire below and fire above and fire within sleep through the things that couldnt have been if you hadnt have been and when the fire moves away fire moves away son why would you say i was the last one all my bones they are gone gone gone take my bones i dont need none cold cold cupboard lord nothing to chew on suck all day on a cherry stone dig a little hole not three inches round spit your pit in a hole in the ground weep upon the spot for the starving of me till up grows a fine young cherry tree when the bough breaks whatll you make for me a little willow cabin to rest on your knee whatll i do with a trinket such as this think of your woman whos gone to the west but im starving and freezing in my measly old bed then ill crawl across the salt flats to stroke your sweet head come across the desert with no shoes on i love you truly or i love noone fire moves away fire moves away son why would you say that i was the last one last one clear the room theres a fire a fire a fire get going and im going to be right behind you and if the love of a woman or two dear could move you to such heights then all i can do is do my darling right by you,"November 6, 2006",Joanna

nigga let me ask this question nigga spoken  kendrick lamar i remember you was conflicted misusing your influence sometimes i did the same abusing my power full of resentment resentment that turned into a deep depression found myself screaming in the hotel room i didnt wanna self destruct the evils of lucy was all around me so i went running for answers until i came home but that didnt stop survivors guilt going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned or maybe how a my foundation was but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned the word was respect just because you wore a different gang color than mines doesnt mean i cant respect you as a black man forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us but i dont know im no mortal man maybe im just another nigga shit and thats all i wrote i was gonna call it another nigga but it aint really a poem i just felt like its something you probably could relate to other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa about a metaphor actually uh you spoke on the ground what you mean by that what the ground represent the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil right thats how i see it my word is bond i seeand the ground is the symbol for the poor people right the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people cause the rich people gonna be so fat and they gonna be so appetizing you know what im saying wealthy appetizing the poor gonna be so poor and hungry right you know what im saying its gonna be like you know what im saying its gonna be there might there might be some cannibalism out this muhfu they might eat the rich you know what im saying aight so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities i see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word i took nothin i took the opportunities i worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it i went from having somebody managing me to me hiring the person that works my management company i changed everything i realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what im saying i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people now its time to make millions for myself you know what im saying i made millions for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now i make millions for for us and through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity by my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true right you know what im saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what im saying i was noticing shit i was punching the right buttons and it was happening so its no problem you know i mean its a problem but im not finna let them know im finna go straight through would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall shit i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been uh threatened with resistance its been met with resistance and not only me but it goes down my family tree you know what im saying its in my veins to fight back aight well how long will you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war im fighting a war i cant win and i wanna lay it all down in this country a black man only have like years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back cause once you turn its like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country and you dont wanna fight no more and if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth year old motherfuckers thats crazy because me being one of your offsprings of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today i think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores and next time its a riot its gonna be like uh bloodshed for real i dont think america know that i think america think we was just playing and its gonna be some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing its gonna be murder you know what im saying its gonna be like nat turner up in this motherfucker you know what im saying its gonna happen thats crazy man in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lot a people dont understand how important it is you know sometimes i can like get behind a mic and i dont know what type of energy ima push out or where it comes from trip me out sometimes because its spirits we aint even really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us damn i wanted to read one last thing to you its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world it says the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him he can no longer see past his own thoughts hes trapped when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city

a ghetto is quite a routine and last night was just another distraction or a reaction of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help held him like a newborn baby and made him feel like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will thats blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive everybodys a victim in my eyes when i ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black a demon glued to my back whispering get em i got em and i aint give a fuck that same mentality i told my brother not to duck in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover the life that i knew as a youngin in pajamas and duntaduns when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb niggas like me never prosper prognosis of a problem child im proud and welldevoted this piru shit been in me forever so forever ima

me with es he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week this is the life of another girl damaged by the system these foster homes i run away and never do miss em see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught three niggas in one room first time i was tossed and im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit my sister died in vain but what point are you tryna gain if you cant fit the pumps i walk in ill wait your rebuttal a little too late and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song cause i dont need the attention bring enough of

concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut off and its my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me  sometimes i look in the mirror and ask myself am i really scared of passin away if its today i hope i hear a cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin the scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance with the other side may come soon and if im doomed may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and im not sure why im infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the schema of wonderin when ima rest and youre right your brother was a brother to me and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me in a direction to speak on somethin thats realer than the tv screen by any means wasnt tryin to offend or come between her personal life i was like it need to be told cursin the life of twenty generations
